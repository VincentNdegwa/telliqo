# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include a **`X-API-Key`** header with the value **`"{YOUR_API_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your API key by visiting your dashboard and clicking <b>Generate API Key</b>. The API key can be sent either as an <code>X-API-Key</code> header or as a Bearer token in the <code>Authorization</code> header.
